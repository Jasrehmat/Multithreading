# Multithreading

## Matrix Multiplication with Threads
This demonstrates how to multiply multiple matrices concurrently using threads in Python. It provides a simple implementation using the threading module to parallelize matrix multiplication tasks.

## Features
1. Generates random matrices of a specified size.
2. Multiplies multiple matrices with varying numbers of threads.
3. Measures the execution time for each configuration.
4. Plots the execution time graph to visualize performance.

## Methodolgy 
Efficiently multiplying matrices in Python using threading involves generating random matrices, utilizing threading for parallel computation, measuring execution time for different thread counts, optimizing thread usage.
Basic idea is that the execution time is minimum for the number of threads= the number of cpu for a particular machine.
